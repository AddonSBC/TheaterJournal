Théâtre diary - Section 1

Today we got to meet the Theater teacher, Andres Montero. We started class by forming a circle and introducing ourselves to each other. After introductions, we started playing a game using a tennis ball, introducing ourselves one last time before starting other activities. This first ball game was useful, as it helped me remember more names and associate them with a face (as we were all facing each other). After a quick round of introductions, we now started calling out each other’s name before throwing the ball.

Personally, I believe that this was an important part of the day, as it helped us get familiar and comfortable with each other, opening the path to another ball game. 
Now, after introductions concluded, we got to play a game where you had to throw the ball to the person on the left of the person who threw the ball to us.

This game was quite enjoyable and fun, especially after a few minutes, when there were multiple balls at play. This game was extremely fun and I feel that it helped us bond and sort of made us better at communicating and understanding each other, even more so considering how we had to communicate our actions and intentions non-verbally.
Finally, we played a more competitive game. The last game revolved around, once again, standing in a circle, but this time, we were standing in small groups and this game was turn-based, meaning that we counted every turn up to 7. Before getting to 7, you have to touch either one of your shoulders, touching your left shoulder makes it so that the person on your left now has to go next and touching your right shoulder, means that it is now the person on the right’s turn.

If your turn falls on turn 7, you have to now position both your hands on a horizontal, parallel position, and your top hand indicates if either the person on your left or your right, gets to start from one. This game goes on until someone messes up, when they would have to leave the circle and wait for the next person to mess up, they will then exchange places.

This Final game was also extremely interesting, as it involved paying close attention to the other people, as well as quick- paced critical thinking skills. On a stage, being able to communicate with others, as well as react quickly to anything are both crucial skills to have, highlighting the usefulness of this kind of training activity.

Today we had a more artistic class. Our first activity involved the voice, and the teacher taught us a little bit about opening up the vocal cords and projecting our voice. His instructions were clear and his mental images helped quite a bit. 
	
After practicing projection for a while, the teacher gave us other practice methods of humming and vibration to clear our throats. These humming methods helped improve our tone and vocal strength, it was clearly a productive activity. 
After warming up the voice, we did a quick little acting activity. We separated into pairs and told each other a short, real story that happened to us. After everyone finished telling their stories, we then gathered in a circle once more and told each other’s stories as though we were the other person.

Finally, we did a more creative activity that involved gathering in pairs to become sculptors and statues, meaning that one of us would guide the other into a position of our choosing, turning them into a statue.

When everyone was done making their statues, all the sculptors gathered to combine their creations into a single display, telling a single story.

I really enjoyed today’s activities, especially since they were more theater-focused and they definitely helped us practice acting and creative skills.

Today we had a fun class.
Balancing liquids in our hands, then falling.
We talked about balancing energy and properly projecting something.

Today we had to present the ways in which several Physics ideas related to the Theater. My group’s topic was the laws of Kepler. The laws of Kepler relate to the different ways that planets move through space and around stars, so me and my group prepared a little dancing presentation to show how choreography works in a similar way.

After my group finished, the next group had to present about the 1st law of Newton. They related the inertia concept to a call-and-response kind of situation, where a character won’t do anything unless another character initiates an action. (The same can apply backwards, where a character won’t stop doing something until another character forces them to).
	
The next group presented Newton's 2nd Law, stating that the impact force of a play equals the physical object times the actor’s energy, paralleling the formula of F=MA. Finally, the last group talked about Newton’s 3rd law, and demonstrated a scene where a character’s reaction is equal to another character’s. The law looks to explain the conservation of energy, but in theater standards it controls the atmosphere and makes sure it has the right emotional energy,

First, we separated in groups and created small choreographies.
Second we walked over lava in wooden blocks
